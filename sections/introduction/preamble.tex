In \cite{resteghini_free_2024} \emph{Resteghini} explores the dual Artin group $A^\vee = A^\vee(W,S,h)$ for some Coxeter system $(W,S)$ and Coxeter element $h \in W$.
He shows that certain conditions on the Coxeter group $W$ and Artin group $A$ imply the natural surjective homomorphism $A \to A^\vee$ is an isomorphism.
In this review we will abstract a construction that gives (as a specific case) the dual Artin group $A^\vee$.
We will then prove a general result about this construction and show that \cite[Proposition 3.9]{resteghini_free_2024} can be re--stated (and re--proved) in this general framework.
